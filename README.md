# ABOUT ME
GenXer here, coming to the field of software development from a long journey through the evolution from DOS floppy disks to our current cutting edges of machine learning.

This has been a journey towards self efficacy and away from the beliefs we are marketed that something or someone can give us more than we already have.  I subscribe to grassroots and person to person learning systems that empower people to have ownership of their learning.   I believe that our future depends on our ability to find a way to listen even when we don't agree and to step into difficulty not walk away from it or other it.

If you are reading this, you are seeing what were my own first steps towards resilience in the face of the oppressive structures that harm us all; especially those of us whose disabilities are not easily identified as "challenges" in a easily identifiable manner. If you relate to this you matter.  If you don't... you still matter.
